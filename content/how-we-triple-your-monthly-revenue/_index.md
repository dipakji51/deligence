## How we Triple your monthly Revenue?

We align ourselves in the Vision of the project and we take actions to fulfil that Vision.

The difference between companies that grow and those that don’t is customer retention. We take measures to ensure that the end-users of the app are satisfied and happy. With this, we help clients to achieve their monthly revenue goals. 

## What out of the box steps we take?

**Putting below one example OUT OF THE BOX -**

**One of our clients currently has 20K+ users who access the app every day. To retain these numbers, we did a massive change in functionality.**

Two years back, the users of the app reported 3-5 issues daily. Some of them were traceable, and some of them were not. We followed a lengthier approach to minimize the bugs. We use to register the Operating System, Browser, Device, and other details from the client to resolve the issue. At times, there were delayed or no responses from the client. This process led to a consecutive delay in fixing app issues that meanwhile affected app performance and experience. 


## Solving the problem 

With a few impromptu brainstorm sessions, we came to the solution of recording the last 5 login details (Users' browser, operating system, device, etc.). So, when the user reports any issue - if it is device/browser specific - we take their details easily, and we solve the bugs quickly to maintain client satisfaction.

## Is it guaranteed that our monthly revenue will increase threefold?

We work as your partner, and we are committed **to triple-fold your monthly revenue.** We need your commitment, as well. And when you and we - both will together work to achieve this objective - the possibilities are very high that we’ll achieve it. However, there is no guarantee.

## How much time will it take to triple the monthly revenue?

If we go with the past data - for one of our clients - it took two years to triple the monthly revenue. For another client - it took 15 months - to quadruple their monthly leads (we don’t have the data of their actual revenue).
