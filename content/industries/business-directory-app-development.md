## Why we do Business Listing Directory App Development?

**The biggest business directories in the world are generating millions of dollars in profit for online publishers.**

Brands like Yelp and Tripadvisor are already making big bucks. Yelp, the review website company, revenue grew 32.2% over 2016 to 2018 to $943 million, with approximately 163,000 businesses now advertising on the platform, while Tripadvisor reported $2.65 billion in revenue in 2018. 
With those figures, local businesses are jumping to create Self-serve portals like Yelp, Tripadvisor, and Zomato that allow companies to generate and pay for online listings themselves. The common reasons reported for Directory development were to direct traffic to the main domain site, to allow the sponsored business promotion, and to connect with searchers.
So, we decided to prepare a development team specialized in launching a successful directory business project for clients who want to step into this domain.
