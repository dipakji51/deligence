Animations are not just appealing to eyes but it also delivers a lot of data - they explain state changes, load errors, confirm actions, and other interactions with the app. 

As mobile devices are getting faster, mobile app designers can input advanced animations to provide a rich user experience. Animation clears any communication gap that may arise with text. Animation and illustrations attract users for its film-like scenes where data changes on every toggle.

Designers these days are eliminating in-app buttons to free up space for more data. The idea is to convey more information on small screens. Buttonless clicks save space and add liquid effects that look eye-appealing.

Virtual and Augmented Reality are widely used in apps to help users give an idea of how the product will look in actual real-world space. Gucci, Decormatters, IKEA, Lenskart are some of the brands who are driving business through their AR/VR based apps.

Unlike old mobile phones, smartphones come with bigger displays and can hold more content on their screens. Smartphone screens are excellent for multitasking.


However, larger displays also have drawbacks: Larger screen makes it difficult to toggle between buttons on the top. Thus, more applications have to position key navigation objects at the bottom. This made the bottom navigation bar became an industry standard for app developers, which helps users get access to basic app features in a single click.


The bottom navigation bar has become an app design trend in 2020. You can already find them in some mobile applications. We also have developed bottom sheets a swipe-up gesture in our most recent<a href="https://www.deligence.com/portfolio/meditation4soul" target="_blank"> meditation app.</a>

It evokes more natural and human-centric feel about the brand. In 2020, many brands are asking to use more illustrations in their apps. Apps with illustrations have shown significant user growth over others. They seem to be more attracted to designs/illustrations that have a more organic and human feel.
